# MIDI software for Agon Light

Currently only contains two simple examples on how to input/output MIDI from
assembly. Both can be assembled on device with [ez80asm](https://github.com/envenomator/agon-ez80asm)

## Todos

- [x] get simple MIDI out working by using the MOS serial commands from BASIC with a tiny bit of inline ASM to build the struct?
- [x] get simple MIDI in working (This might require more asm or c)
- [ ] write library to make this more accessible from BASIC (read up on how to extend BBC basic)
