# UEXT MIDI Interface

Although specifically made for my AgonLight2, this interface should work for all boards with a UEXT connector if the UART is exposed.

## Status

Prototyping phase. The kicad files in this repo are just me playing around. The schematics are almost done (I wonder if I need to include the optional buffer that, I think is not present on the UEXT header in contrast to the GPIO headers), but the layout is just a first try.

I will breadboard the in- and output circuits first before continuing with the board design.
